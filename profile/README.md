# Trust Labs by NFH (Networks for Humanity)

## Building fundamental trust infrastructure for the AI-native world.

Trust Labs is a suite of products by Networks for Humanity (NFH). Our mission is to architect and build the tools necessary to establish verifiable trust across the spectrum of digital actors: humans and agents.

We believe that in an AI-native world, trust cannot be assumed; it must be cryptographically verifiable, privacy-preserving, and rooted in human-centric values.
